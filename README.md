# LiDAR Data
This code reads .bin file (specially obtained from LiDAR), stores that to a .csv file, and plots the output in a point-cloud format.
It is tested with the raw data available at [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php).
For practice, [synced+rectified data] from "2011_09_26_drive_0002" may be downloaded. In order to run the code, changes to the input path, base directory etc. should be made accordingly.
